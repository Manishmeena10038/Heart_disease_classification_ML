#Heart Disease Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for detecting heart disease in individuals based on clinical and demographic attributes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to create a reliable tool for early detection and risk assessment of heart disease, enabling timely intervention and personalized healthcare.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn
Dataset
The project utilizes the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, comprising various clinical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and electrocardiographic measurements. The dataset contains 1025 instances, each representing a patient, with 14 attributes including the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing and Collection:
Load the heart disease dataset.
Handle missing values, if any.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and distribution.
Splitting the Features and Target:
Separate the dataset into features and the target variable.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:
Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression).
Train the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy score metrics.
Assess the model's ability to generalize on unseen data.
Building a Predictive System:
Define input data representing the features of a single instance.
Make predictions using the trained model.
Interpret the prediction results.
Results
The project achieves promising results with a selected machine learning algorithm, demonstrating robust performance in accurately classifying individuals with and without heart disease.

Future Work
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to improve model performance.
Incorporate advanced techniques such as feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
Explore additional datasets or features to enhance predictive capabilities.
